### Impact of strategies to prioritise vaccination with one dose versus delivering second dose

#### Nicholas Grassly 17 May 2021

### Summary
This is the rshiny code for a model of the direct impact of vaccination on mortality due to COVID-19 when timely delivery of a second dose is prioritised or when the second dose is delayed to allow more people to be immunised with a first dose. The model requires estimates of the efficacy of one and two doses of vaccine, waning of efficacy, and a definition of groups prioritised for vaccination, coverage targets and their relative exposure and risk of mortality (these may just be specific age-groups, or include other groups such as health workers). The model takes as input the vaccine supply and weekly delivery constraints on the number of doses that can be administered. Parameters can also be altered according to whether a variant of concern (VoC) is prevalent that may affect vaccine efficacy. The model also allows for a proportion of the population to already be immune and for disease incidence to be constant, increasing or decreasing over time. It does not account for the impact of COVID-19 mortality on demography or the acquisition of natural immunity during the simulation period. Run the app to see more details.
